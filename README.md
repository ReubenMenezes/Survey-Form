# What this is
This is the first project of the freeCode [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). I originally completed this project in early September 2021 but decided to redo it recently.

You can read the user stories and objective for this project at `objective.md`.

# Reflection
This was a really enjoyable project. Not only did it make me have to work with and research numerous new attributes, but it also helped me gain confidence in my styling. I included media queries to make the site fully responsive and thoroughly enjoyed challenging myself while working with them. I primarily used flexbox to position my inputs in a column.
